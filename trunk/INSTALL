0. INTRO

GtkPacman is a package manager based on pacman written completely in python. It's pourpose is to make the system administration easier for package management tasks. It's a gui, so the novice will not be frightened by the command line, and its design is intuitive. Since it's in python you do not need to compile it, and installation is thus fast and easy.

1. INSTALLATION

There's a few of modes to install GtkPacman, here's them all.

1.1 setup.py install

Source code tarballs ship a setup.py script, which can install gtkpacman on your filesyste. Since this files will not be under the control of gtkpacman this installation mode it's not recomended. Indeed it exists only for the package builders.

1.2 Install from community repo

This method uses pacman to install gtkpacman. You have to uncomment the [community] entry in your /etc/pacman.conf and then use this command:

     # pacman -Sy gtkpacman

This will download the community repo's database and it will install gtkpacman.

1.3 Install from berlios.de package

On berlios.de you can find packages made on my own. They're built only for testing releases, since the stable ones are avaible from community repo (see 1.2).
To use this method you have to download the *.pkg.tar.gz file from berlios.de download server and use this procedure:

     # cd path/to/gtkpacman/package
     # pacman -U gtkpacman-X.Y-Z.pkg.tar.gz 
	(where X.Y is the gtkpacman version and Z the package release)

1.4 Install from AUR

A PKGBUILD for svn version of gtkpacman. USE IT ONLY FOR TESTING PUORPOSES.
To use it you can use aurbuild (if you have it installed), or you can download the PKGBUILD and build the package by hand.
Using aurbuild the command you need is:

     # aurbuild -s gtkpacman-svn

Then enter 'v' at the prompt to use versionpkg (you need to install it). versionpkg is avaible on community repo. aurbuild must be built by hand downloading it PKGBUILD from AUR.

If you don't have/don't want to use aurbuild you can download the archive from AUR. Do this when you downloaded it:

     # cd /path/to/gtkpacman-svn/archive
     # tar xzf gtkpacman-svn.tar.gz
     # cd gtkpacman-svn
     # versionpkg
     # pacman -U gtkpacman-svn-X-Y.pkg.tar.gz
        (where X is the rev from svn and Y the release of the package, usually 1)

1.5 Install from PKGBUILD from berlios.de

A PKGBUILD is also avaible on berlios.de for the dev releases. Tou use it download it and use this procedure:

     # cd /path/to/PKGBUILD
     # mkdir gtkpacman/
     # mv PKGBUILD gtkpacman/
     # cd gtkpacman/
     # makepkg
     # pacman -U gtkpacman-X.Y-Z.pkg.tar.gz
